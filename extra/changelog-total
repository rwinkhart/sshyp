sshyp 2022.02.16.fr4.4

The High-Tech Shears Update - Patch 4

This release automatically generates user-created folders on new client devices.

Note: Upgrading to releases in the fr4 series requires the configuration ("sshyp tweak") to be re-done, as a device name now must be set (for multi-client deletion). Even upgrading from fr4.3 to fr4.4 will require re-running "sshyp tweak" due to file name changes.

Changes:

- old device names are now automatically deleted (locally) when running "sshyp tweak", to prevent conflicts

sshyp 2022.02.16.fr4

The High-Tech Shears Update

This release adds in a major feature: multi-client deletion (details below)

Note: This release requires the configuration ("sshyp tweak") to be re-done, as a device name now must be set (for multi-client deletion).

Features:

- added multi-client deletion
    ^ this means that when an entry is deleted from one client (and thus the server), if another client that has a copy of the deleted entry tries to sync, instead of re-uploading the deleted entry, it will now also have its entry deleted.
    ^ the current implementation requires a new Python script in addition to sshyp and sshync

Changes:

- fixed an issue where sshyp would use the wrong SSH key when trying to delete entries from or create folders on the server
    ^ this is a fix that was recently applied to sshync - turns out I made the same mistake in sshyp
- deleting folders should now work properly with "sshyp shear" if the directory is entered with a following "/"

&&

rpass 2021.11.01.mr5.1

The Notetaker Update - Patch 1

This is the FINAL release of "rpass".
After this release, the project will be rebranded as "sshyp".

rpass's syncing system is fundamentally broken, hence the need for "sshyp"
and its new syncing system. I would highly advise against using this release.

New features:

- none

Changes:

rpass 2021.10.07.mr5

The Notetaker Update - Fifth main release of rpass

This release overhauls the note-taking system and provides general improvements
to overall code quality, including optimizations, bug fixes, and security improvements.

New features:

- notes are now edited in nano and can be split across multiple lines
- password confirmation has been added for entry deletion

Changes:

- fixed issues with copying passwords with certain special characters, e.g. '"()|
- auto-generated ssh key now uses ed25519, rather than rsa-3072
- entry format modified to include a blank line before the notes field (old format still mostly compatible)
- rpass is now much better at catching bad arguments
- some general code cleanup

Planned for next update (The Housekeeping Update Pt. 2):

- add new file list w/color and w/o extensions + proper displaying of nested folders
- ability to pass entries as arguments for more functions
- manpage
- add more comments to code
- validate for Python 3.10

Planned for next update (The cryptpass Update):

- initial implementation of a data store for other applications (libsecret alt.)
- modularize code in preparation for GUI frontends 

Planned, no timeline:

- create separate gui frontend targetting mobile devices (first Linux phones, maybe Android at a later date - official iOS client not likely)
    ^ the gui will also function on desktop linux
- make platform agnostic (add Windows support and package for more Linux distributions, such as Alpine and Debian)
- auto-completion on tab (currently unsure of best way to make this work)
