sshyp v1.0

The Polished Trotters Update

This release brings 'sshyp' in line with the original goals of the project.
As such, it is being crowned "v1.0", and is considered a stable base for future expansions.

Features:

- sshyp has been modified to run on Haiku, an open-source re-implementation of BeOS
- the entry format has been changed to support entries created in pass/password-store
    ^ this change requires existing entry libraries to be converted - see the sshyp v1.0 release page on GitHub for a conversion script
- majorly overhauled visual experience for sshyp
    ^ this includes a new entry list, a new entry readout, coloured output, and more!
- entries can now optionally be passed as arguments, directly
    ^ as opposed to the user being prompted for an entry name after running a command

Changes:

- corrected outdated liscensing and copyright information
- 'if __name__=="__main__":' convention is now used
- help screens have been overhauled
- improved password generator to guarantee more secure results
- fixed errors when trying to sync with a multi-word entry on the server
- sshync now uses 'scp' (via the sftp protocal), rather than 'sftp'
- rename function now properly allows for renaming folders
- renaming an entry/folder will now properly delete the old entry/folder from the server
- entry previews at the time of entry creation/editing no longer require entering the gpg password more times than necessary
- the clipboard now automatically clears after 30 seconds
- sshyp server no longer needs to create copies of its libraries in ~/
- ...and lots of minor (under the hood) changes!
